# Programming and Languages Study Repository

This repository is where I store my Java exercises and projects. They help me better understand the language and put into practice what I learn in college, complementing my assignments.

## Repository Structure

- **exercises/**: Contains programming exercises to reinforce basic concepts.
- **projects/**: Includes practical projects that apply advanced concepts.

## Repository Rules

1. **Content**: Only exercises and projects for study purposes. Do not include personal or commercial tasks.
2. **Organization**: Clear and consistent structure with separate directories.
3. **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards and comment code where necessary.
4. **History and Versioning**: Use clear commit messages and branches for new additions.
5. **Testing**: Include and run unit tests.
6. **Security**: Do not include sensitive information and configure `.gitignore` appropriately.
7. **Collaboration**: Follow the established contribution policy and review code.
8. **Documentation**: Keep `README.md` updated and provide useful examples and tips.

## What is Prohibited

1. **Sensitive Information**: Do not include personal data, passwords, API keys, or any confidential information in the repository.
2. **Third-Party Code**: Do not add code that is not your own or not properly licensed for use. If using third-party code, ensure it is allowed and provide proper attribution.
3. **Unrelated Changes**: Do not add tasks or projects that are not related to the goal of studying and practicing Java. Keep the focus on the proposed practices and exercises.
4. **Unnecessary Files**: Avoid including temporary files, IDE-specific configuration files (such as Eclipseâ€™s `.classpath` or `.project`), and other files not needed for the project's functionality.
5. **Malicious or Inappropriate Code**: It is prohibited to include any code that is malicious, inappropriate, or could compromise the integrity and security of the repository.
6. **Undocumented Changes**: Avoid making significant changes to the code without updating the corresponding documentation. Changes should be clearly documented in commits and in `README.md` when necessary.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b new-branch`).
3. Make your changes and add commits (`git commit -am 'Description of the change'`).
4. Push the branch (`git push origin new-branch`).
5. Create a Pull Request.
